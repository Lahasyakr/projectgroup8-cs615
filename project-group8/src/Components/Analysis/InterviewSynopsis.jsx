                        We interviewed a mid-aged man who is married and has two children. He was determined to enhance the family's bonding experience and draw his two children, aged 8 and 10, away from the captivating screens that often consume their attention. While he recognizes the educational and recreational value of board games, he faces several challenges in buying them. The costs can quickly add up, making it financially impractical to continuously purchase new games. Furthermore, predicting which games will connect with his children is uncertain, and the clutter of accumulated games poses a storage challenge. In the interview, he highlights these obstacles, emphasizing the need for a more cost-effective, diverse, and convenient solution to introduce his family to the joys of board gaming and quality family time.
